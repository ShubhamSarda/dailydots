# Daily Dots

A clean and minimal daily journal and mood tracker built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Track your daily thoughts, emotions, and build a journaling habit.

## Overview

Daily Dots helps you:
- Write one journal entry per day
- Track your mood alongside your thoughts
- View past entries and measure your journaling streak
- Keep your data private (stored locally in your browser)

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **React Router** - Client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first styling
- **localStorage** - Data persistence (frontend-only, no backend required)

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/       # Reusable UI components (Modal, Navigation, MoodSelector)
├── pages/            # Route-level pages (Home, MyJournals, AddNewJournal)
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks (context providers, utilities)
├── services/         # Data layer (journalService for localStorage)
├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/            # Helper functions (date utilities)
```

## Data Storage

Currently, all journal entries are stored in **localStorage** in your browser. No backend is required.

**Key:** `dailydots_journal_entries`

**Structure:**
```json
[
  {
    "date": "2026-01-02",
    "mood": "😊 Happy",
    "content": "Today was a great day...",
    "createdAt": "2026-01-02T10:30:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-01-02T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

### Future Backend Integration

The project is architected to support backend integration (e.g., Supabase) by swapping out `journalService.ts`. The Context API and component layer remain unchanged.

## Environment Variables

This project does not currently use environment variables. If you add a backend (e.g., Supabase), create a `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Example for future Supabase integration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## Browser Support

Modern browsers with ES6+ support:

## Roadmap

Potential future features:
- Supabase integration for cloud sync
- Search and filtering
- Mood analytics and insights
- Export journal as PDF or markdown
- Dark mode
